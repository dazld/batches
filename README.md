# batches

A Clojure library designed to accumulate values from an input channel and periodically provide them to an output channel.

## Usage
```clojure
=> (require '[clojure.core.async :as ac])
=> (require '[batches.core :refer [accumulate]])
=> (def in (ac/chan))
=> (def out (ac/chan))
=> (def foo (accumulate 3000 in out)))
=> (doseq [v (range 10)]
     (ac/put! in 1))
=> (reduce + 0 (ac/<!! out)))
10
; stop the accumulator
=> (and (ac/>!! in :stop) (ac/<!! out))
[]

```
